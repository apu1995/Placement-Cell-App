TPC does not guarantee a job.\n\n
2. The placement facility is available to all the students registered with TPC through the policy
ONE JOB TO ONE STUDENT AT THE FIRST INSTANCE.\n\n
3. There is no restriction on appearing in interviews until the first job is secured. A student will be
considered to have secured a job if her/his name appears in the selection list.\n\n4. If student gets multiple offers in the end of a day, she/he will be free to choose any one between
them.
\n\n5. Students must keep their Identity Card with them at the time of PPT / Test / Group Discussion /
Personal Interviews and produce the same when demanded by the visiting team or TPC staff.
\n\n6. The TPC strongly discourages the students to go for off campus placements in companies that
are coming to LNMIIT campus, as this affects the companyÂ­institute relations adversely.
\n\n7. Students are also requested to forward contacts they have, if any, in different companies so that
TPC may formally invite these companies for placements"
